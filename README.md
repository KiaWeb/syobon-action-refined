# Syobon Action Refined

Welcome! Syobon Action Refined is a better version of Syobon Action, doubling as an Electron app so you can just run it without building. Now the file size may be a lot, but, that's maybe on me...


# Files

It contains a folder with the Emscripten source, in which I created batch files `build.cmd` and `run.cmd`. If you just want to rebuild the game, you can use `build.cmd`. Or, if you want to run it in your browser (without Electron) you can use `run.cmd`.
You can go in the **electron/** folder and use `run.cmd` to open a window in Electron.

## Requirements

Here's the links to the requirements of the app, because it does need some stuff.
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
I'd say this version of Python is the best for the game:
[Python 3.14.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3142/)

## Operating systems

Microsoft® Windows® is the only operating system I mainly made this for. For people on Linux and macOS, well, I'm not that educated, please be a professional and build it for yourself.

## Licensing

All I ask for is for you to give me and Koji Kondo credits to the game. Please.

## How to download

No releases, just download the ZIP and use the instructions.

## Walkthrough
It's gonna be on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/4fIzwME5-oI).
